## Introduction

This is my first standalone react project doing an art inspiration generator. The project can be done with pure js, but running through a react project from 0 for the first time allows me to appreciate the logic of the framework, familiarize myself with the fixed routines, and complete the most basic environment configuration.

## Description

Clicking a button generates different inspiration prompts and the background changes randomly. That means react has to control the html and css part. There are still a lot of small obstacles in the process of practicing, but it's still a great sense of accomplishment after overcoming them.

## Required timespan

1-2 nights

## Setup

### Download the codes and open it in your IDE (e.g. VS Code)
### run `npm start` in the IDE terminal to initialize react, you will see a new window open in your browser
### run `cd path-to-your-current-dictionary` in your computer terminal
### (don't know how to find the path? click on the folder you are working on, right click it, then press option - copy as pathname)
### continue in the computer terminal, run `server node.js` to get the node.js work
### now things work in the browser window. If it doesn't, refresh.
